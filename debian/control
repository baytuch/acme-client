Description: acme-client is an Automatic Certificate Management Environment
 acme-client is an Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
 client: it looks in its configuration for a domain section corresponding
 to the domain given as command line argument and uses that configuration
 to retrieve an X.509 certificate which can be used to provide domain name
 validation (i.e. prove that the domain is who it says it is).  The cer‚Äê
 tificates are typically used to provide HTTPS for web servers, but can be
 used in any situation where domain name validation is required (such as
 mail servers).
