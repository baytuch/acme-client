NAME

     acme-client.conf — acme-client configuration file


DESCRIPTION

     The acme-client.conf file is divided into the following main sections:

     Macros
       User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the configuration file.

     Authorities
       Certificate authorities (CAs) that can be contacted via ACME.

     Domains
       Certificate specifications.
       Additional configuration files can be included with the include keyword, for example:

       include "/etc/acme-client.sub.conf"

     The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash (‘\’).
     Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark (‘#’), and extend
     to the end of the current line. Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
     the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.

     Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, underscore, or '/' must be quoted.


MACROS

     Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context. Macro names must start
     with a letter, digit, or underscore, and may contain any of those characters. Macro
     names may not be reserved words. Macros are not expanded inside quotes.

     For example:

       api_url="https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
       authority letsencrypt {
         api url $api_url
         account key "/etc/acme/letsencrypt-privkey.pem"
       }


AUTHORITIES

     The configured certificate authorities.

     Each authority section starts with a declaration of the name identifying a certificate authority:

     authority name {...}

     The name is a string used to reference this certificate authority.

     It is followed by a block of options enclosed in curly brackets:

     account key file [keytype]

     Specify a file used to identify the user of this certificate authority. keytype can be rsa or
     ecdsa. It defaults to rsa.

     api url url

     Specify the url under which the ACME API is reachable.

     contact contact

     Optional contact URLs that the authority can use to contact the client for issues related to
     this account.


DOMAINS

     The certificates to be obtained through ACME.

     domain handle {...}

       Each domain section begins with the domain keyword followed by an identifier for this domain block.
       It is followed by a block of options enclosed in curly brackets:

     domain name name

       The name to be used as the common name component of the subject of the X.509 certificate.
       This is optional. If not specified, the handle of the domain block will be used as common name.

     alternative names {...}

       A list of alternative names, comma or space separated, for which the certificate will be valid.
       The common name is included automatically if this option is present, but there is no automatic
       conversion/inclusion between "www." and plain domain name forms.

     domain key file [keytype]

       The private key file for which the certificate will be obtained. keytype can be rsa or ecdsa.
       It defaults to rsa. If the key file does not exist, acme-client(1) will generate a key itself
       (4096-bit for rsa or secp384r1 for ecdsa).

     domain certificate file

       The filename of the certificate that will be issued. This is optional if domain full chain
       certificate is specified. A backup with name file.1 is created if file exists.

     domain chain certificate file

       The filename in which to store the certificate chain that will be returned by the certificate
       authority. It needs to be in the same directory as the domain certificate (or in a subdirectory)
       and can be specified as a relative or absolute path. This setting is optional. A backup with
       name file.1 is created if file exists.

     domain full chain certificate file

       The filename in which to store the full certificate chain that will be returned by the certificate
       authority. It needs to be in the same directory as the domain certificate (or in a subdirectory)
       and can be specified as a relative or absolute path. This is a combination of the domain
       certificate and the domain chain certificate in one file, and is required by most browsers.
       This is optional if domain certificate is specified. A backup with name file.1 is created if file exists.

    sign with authority

       The certificate authority (as declared above in the AUTHORITIES section) to use. If this setting is
       absent, the first authority specified is used.

    challengedir path

       The directory in which the challenge file will be stored. If it is not specified, a default of
       /var/www/acme will be used.
